--------
2/27/2018
* src/main - cleaned up UE/fake subtraction
* draw_ChPS - fixed injet histograms
* comp_ChPS - added injet comparison to FF with fit quality
* pPbFragmentation package:
*   added Pythia powheg scheme
*   fixed jet corrector, Pythia and pythiapowheg now handled at analysis code level
*   Added fake with and without secondary (truth jet pT) histograms
--------
2/20/2018
* Updated UE subtraction (using MB method for < 10 GeV PbPb, TM for > 10 GeV PbPb and all pp) in main and draw_ChPS
* fixed cent_bin_fine (using cent_scheme 30 instead of 31) and alignment fix bug (to make sure overlay tracks also have the corrected charged trk pt) and added jet cleaning for pp in PbPbFFShape
* Added histograms for checking UE (truth jet pT and reco trk pT)
* Brought up to svn version
---------
2/12/2018
* added plots for internal note, fixed ranges, labellings
* redid comp_chps from beginning to compare different spectra
* DONE: need to properly implement MB method UE subtraction for PbPb MC. Some problem
with weighting
----------
2/5/2018
* added background2signal plots in draw_ChPS
* fixed UE normalization for PbPb MC
* minor title fixes
----------
2/5/2018
* added ability to run from command line config
* fixed naming conventions
* added code to compare PbPb pp data (final and pre-unfolding)
* new UE subtraction (MB method) implemented for PbPb data
* added code for correction factors for MB method UE
* added automated script to run over PbPb, pp (data and MC)
* added test config file (ff_config)
----------
2/1/2018
* fixed trigger for PbPbFFShape
* fixed calibration for pp in PbPbFFShape
* minor changes to offline code
----------
1/31/2018
* first changelog
* PbPbFFShape.cxx now runs over pp data. Trigger PS is 1 for j85, first
"trigger" is 6. Centbin is set to 5 for pp
* output_dev/unfold/src/main.cxx - Cleaned up output file names
* output_dev/unfold/get_posCorr.c - Cleaned up output file names
* output_dev/unfold/draw_ChPS.c - added plots for UE, injet plots, etc
